### Okay, what even is this?

This is a work-in-progress library providing control over sending packets between a Server and a Client. 

### What is a "packet"?

*Packets* are streams of bytes sent between computers to share data, like text messages for a chat app or a player's health in a multi-player videogame. This library lets you send and receive packets of your own.
